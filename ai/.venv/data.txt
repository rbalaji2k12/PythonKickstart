"Fetch a User story in JIRA for Current sprint and write a test case (positive and negative) manually for each user story.
we will generate the Test Cases based on Scenarios in the user story. "
"While executing Automation script , Date was required to reset every day. Since , the test data format is csv, date was not able to automatically reset . 
so, we used java method to generate new csv file from excel file everyday using Generative UI (Developer Assist by Eviden).

we have executed these process through java Syntax using Selenium tool and cuccumber framework with help of Develope assist (Generative AI)."

"Generative AI Powered Semantics Search." In a world cluttered with generic search engines, this cutting-edge solution harnesses the power of generative AI to understand not just what users type, but what they truly mean.
Analyze code for adherence to coding standards, identify potential bugs or security vulnerabilities, and suggest improvements. Suggest refactoring options to improve code maintainability, readability, and adherence to design principles.
AI can monitor data pipelines for errors and automatically trigger corrective actions, ensuring seamless data flow.
These intelligent assistants analyze code patterns and project history, providing invaluable insights to suggest optimal branching strategies.
This tool can provide intuitive interfaces for non-technical users to access and explore data, fostering wider data utilization through simple English language commands. This results in fewer queries for reports.
Synthetic data is generated by AI trained on real-world data samples. It is created using algorithms and is used to test and train AI models when real data is either not available or has to be augmented. 
Train AI models to identify dependencies between tasks and determine optimal scheduling arrangements, minimizing execution time and resource utilization.
Employ natural language processing (NLP) to understand user commands and automatically generate Airflow DAGs, for different enviornments like Dev,Test,UAT and production  reducing manual configuration.
for DAG status and issues Harnessing NLP for Natural Language Summaries of DAG Execution Status and Historical Trends
AI can forecast workload demands and automatically scale resources up or down, preventing downtime and optimizing cost during peak and low periods
With minimal input or problem statement, the AI tool will generate story content. It will also leverage AI to identify existing stories with similar functionalities or dependencies, facilitating better project organization and avoiding duplication.
Integrate MO4D with application (Salesforce), which will be helpful for Developers and BA/Product managers to get answers on the fly, by simply asking questions from Application (Salesforce) and then in backend MO4D will return the response back to them.
"The main idea of this app is it should be helpful to fetch instant data whenever required, especially when a specific business reports are not in handy.
The app should be compatible to connect with any of the existing database, it may contain sales data, production data, warehouse data, etc.,
Most of the databaseâ€™s data can be fetched easily through SQL, so hope it will be easy to build queries based on user prompts.
So, the User can be able to give voice or chat prompt through app to get his required information. Whenever user prompts, need to fetch appropriate answer additon with a similar type question(prompts) need to be popup. Where, if he feels the answer is not appropriate then he can choose from the popped-up prompts.
Once this app is developed, then it will be easy to plugin to any database and can fetch data instantly."
For e-commerce portals, there are more than thousands of reviews which would take a lot of time to go through. We can use Gen AI for creating summary of all the reviews and provide important 3-4 points.
Gen AI facilitates the generation of Flowcharts and Diagrams for SAP Reports, allowing for the accurate depiction of the program flow. This capability not only enhances clarity but also contributes to time savings for developers
